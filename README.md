# Context Switcher for Blender

## Overview
Context Switcher is a Blender addon that allows users to quickly switch between different area types and workspaces in the Blender interface. It provides a convenient popup menu accessible via a keyboard shortcut or search, making it faster and easier to change both your workspace and layout configuration.

## Features
- Quick switch to Blender area types or Workspaces.
- Popup menu at cursor location.
- Configurable shortcut for instant access.

## Usage
There are three ways to access the Context Switcher:

1. **Shortcut**: Set a shortcut in preferences to open the Context Switcher popup at your cursor location. I have mine set to `control` + `right click` which I find nice.
2. **View Menu**: In the 3D Viewport, go to View > Context Switch.
3. **Search**: Press `F3` or use the search menu, then type "Context Switcher" to find and execute the command.

Once the popup appears:
- The leftmost column shows available workspaces, with the current workspace highlighted.
- The remaining columns show different categories of editor types.
- Your current editor type is highlighted in its respective category.
- Simply click on any workspace or editor type to switch to it.
